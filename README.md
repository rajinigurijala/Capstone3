## Census Income Data
Supervised Machine Learning Project

### Overview
This data set includes around 41 demographic and employment related attributes such as age, gender, race, occupation, education, class of the worker, capital gain, income level etc. and 199,523 obeservations of people living in US.

Based on this data a predictive machine learning model is created to determine the income level for people in the US.

After performing exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, data visualizations, we had split the data into train and test data with 64% and 33% proportions.

An evaluation of various supervised machine learning algorithms resulted in selecting and training the best model. The Gradient Boosting model is refined further to predict income with 94% accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, sklearn
- Jupyter Notebook
